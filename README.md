# Spam Mail Prediction System

## Overview

This project implements a Spam Mail Prediction System using Machine Learning with Python. 
The goal is to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content. 
Spam emails often contain misleading offers or promotions, and this system aims to filter them effectively.

## Libraries Used

- NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy score of approximately 96% on both the training and testing datasets, indicating a strong performance in classifying emails correctly.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem of spam email classification. 
The Spam Mail Prediction System effectively filters out unwanted emails, enhancing the user experience in managing their inbox.
